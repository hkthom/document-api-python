We're just getting started and have plans to expand what you find here. Help us by submitting feedback, issues, and pull requests!\n\n\nDocument API\n\n\nThe Document API provides a supported way to programmatically make updates to Tableau workbook and data source files. If you've been making changes to these file types by directly updating the XML--that is, by XML hacking--this SDK is for you :)\n\n\nFeatures include:\n- Support for 9.X, and 10.X workbook and data source files\n  - Including TDSX and TWBX files\n- Getting connection information from data sources and workbooks\n  - Server Name\n  - Username\n  - Database Name\n  - Authentication Type\n  - Connection Type\n- Updating connection information in workbooks and data sources\n  - Server Name\n  - Username\n  - Database Name\n- Getting Field information from data sources and workbooks\n  - Get all fields in a data source\n  - Get all fields in use by certain sheets in a workbook\n\n\nWe don't yet support creating files from scratch, adding extracts into workbooks or data sources, or updating field information\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nTo use this SDK, you must have Python installed. You can use either 2.7.X or 3.3 and later.\n\n\nInstalling the latest stable version (preferred)\n\n\npip install tableaudocumentapi\n\n\n\n\nInstalling From Source\n\n\nDownload the \n.zip\n file that contains the SDK. Unzip the file and then run the following command:\n\n\npip install -e <directory containing setup.py>\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the Development Version from Git\n\n\nOnly do this if you know you want the development version, no guarantee that we won't break APIs during development\n\n\npip install git+https://github.com/tableau/document-api-python.git@development\n\n\n\n\nIf you go this route, but want to switch back to the non-development version, you need to run the following command before installing the stable version:\n\n\npip uninstall tableaudocumentapi\n\n\n\n\nBasics\n\n\nThe following example shows the basic syntax for using the Document API to update a workbook:\n\n\nfrom tableaudocumentapi import Workbook\n\nsourceWB = Workbook('WorkbookToUpdate.twb')\n\nsourceWB.datasources[0].connections[0].server = \"MY-NEW-SERVER\"\nsourceWB.datasources[0].connections[0].dbname = \"NEW-DATABASE\"\nsourceWB.datasources[0].connections[0].username = \"benl\"\n\nsourceWB.save()\n\n\n\n\nWith Data Integration in Tableau 10, a data source can have multiple connections. To access the connections simply index them like you would datasources.\n\n\nfrom tableaudocumentapi import Workbook\n\nsourceWB = Workbook('WorkbookToUpdate.twb')\n\nsourceWB.datasources[0].connections[0].server = \"MY-NEW-SERVER\"\nsourceWB.datasources[0].connections[0].dbname = \"NEW-DATABASE\"\nsourceWB.datasources[0].connections[0].username = \"benl\"\n\nsourceWB.datasources[0].connections[1].server = \"MY-NEW-SERVER\"\nsourceWB.datasources[0].connections[1].dbname = \"NEW-DATABASE\"\nsourceWB.datasources[0].connections[1].username = \"benl\"\n\n\nsourceWB.save()\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nImport the \nWorkbook\n object from the \ntableaudocumentapi\n module.\n\n\nTo open a workbook, instantiate a \nWorkbook\n object and pass the file name as the first argument.\n\n\nThe \nWorkbook\n object exposes a list of \ndatasources\n in the workbook\n\n\nEach data source object has a \nconnection\n object that supports a \nserver\n, \ndbname\n, and \nusername\n property.\n\n\nSave changes to the workbook by calling the \nsave\n or \nsave_as\n method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduced In v 2.4\n\n\nThis call was added in version Tableau 10.3, XSDv2.5\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nThe downloadable package contains several example scripts that show more detailed usage of the Document API.",
